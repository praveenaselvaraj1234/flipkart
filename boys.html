                Formal wear is still considered elegant and classic. While many people fear dressing formally will be
                boring, this document provides tips to style formal wear creatively. It suggests incorporating colors
                like olive and adding striped blazers. Formal wear should fit well and avoid being overly cluttered with
                accessories. Consistency is key to developing a polished formal style. Accessories like glasses can also
                help create a more sophisticated look when paired with formal attire.
