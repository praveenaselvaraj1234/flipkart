<p>What is an Old Garden Rose? To history it is a rose being of a class in existence before the
    year 1867. Why 1867? Simple. This is the year a rose named “La France” was introduced. La France is considered
    to the be the first Hybrid Tea. It is the offspring of the Hybrid Perpetual “Madame Victor Verdier” with the Tea
    rose “Madame Bravy”. The hybridizer was Guillot and what marked La France as being different from other roses
    was the high centered blossom we associate with Hybrid Teas of today. The name Hybrid Tea in fact comes from a
    wedding of the classes of the parents of La France. A Hybrid Perpetual and a Tea rose The hybridizer was Guillot and what marked La France as being different from other roses
    was the high centered blossom we associate with Hybrid Teas of today. The name Hybrid Tea in fact comes from a
    wedding of the classes of the parents of La France. A Hybrid Perpetual and a Tea rose.

    Notice I use the words “class of roses” in existence before 1867. This means that even though say a particular
    Bourbon (a class of Old Garden Rose) was introduced after 1867 it’s still an Old Garden Rose.
    <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; In fact it’s possible that an Old Garden Rose could be hybridized and introduced to the
    growing public today. The rose breeder Paul Barden comes to mind.

    Class of roses also brings us to the other part of the definition of Old Garden Roses. Modern Roses refer to
    Hybrid Teas, Floribundas, Miniatures etc. Sub classes within the label “Modern Roses”. It’s the same with Old
    Garden Roses. To put it plainly, Old Garden Roses are not a class of roses but rather a group of classes that
    fit one definition. That definition is the class was in existence before 1867.
    So if you hear folks speak of Old Garden Roses then launch into Bourbons, Albas, Damasks, Teas and so on relax.
    They are only talking of the classes of roses that make up the group Old Garden Roses.
<br>&nbsp;
    What are the classes of roses that make up Old Garden Roses? There are a lot but generally they fall into two
    subclasses; I use the terms Antique and Old Roses. Old Roses are those found in Europe before the very late
    1700s and Antique Roses are those who can trace part of their ancestry back to R. Chinensis (The China Rose)
    which was the first true repeat blooming rose known to the Western World and was not introduced to Europe until
    around 1792. While this sounds confusing and technical, there is another way to separate Antique and Old Roses.
    Old roses for the most part do not repeat bloom and Antique Roses for the most part do. Why? Because of the
    influence of R. Chinensis into breeding programs. With this repeat blooming ability roses forever changed,
    Antique Roses were born and later all of our Modern Roses. With all of this in mind here are the classes that
    make up the group Old Garden Roses. (There are certainly other classes and I don’t claim to be 100% correct but
    for the purposes of this blog these are the ones I’m listing..</p>

<p> a true "wildflower." There are over 100 of these worldwide, some native to
    North America, many from the Orient and Europe. These true wild roses are all single with exactly five petals —
    never more, and almost all of them are pink, with a few whites and reds, and even fewer that range toward
    yellow. (By the way, there are now over 20,000 hybrids, with about 200 new ones The hybridizer was Guillot and what marked La France as being different from other roses
