    <h1 id="modern">What are modern roses?</h1>
    <h3 id="modrenn">Modern roses encompass a wide range of types, including hybrid teas, floribundas, grandifloras,
        polyanthas,
        miniatures, shrubs, climbers, and groundcover roses. Each type offers unique characteristics and growth habits,
        making them versatile options for any garden.</h3>
    <h3>Modern Roses are those varieties bred after 1867. Unlike Old Garden Roses which bloom once a year, Modern Roses
        bloom continuously. They also have a larger bloom size and longer vase life but lack fragrance. They are also
        somewhat less hardy and disease resistant. The following listed below are classifications we have included in
        our Rose Garden. </h3>
