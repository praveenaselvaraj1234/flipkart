    <h2>The True "Wild" Roses</h2>
    <h3 id="wildd"> &nbsp;The botanical term for wild rose is "species rose", which means just what it says — a species
        that occurs
        naturally, with no help from man — a true "wildflower." There are over 100 of these worldwide, some native to
        North America, many from the Orient and Europe. These true wild roses are all single with exactly five petals —
        never more, and almost all of them are pink, with a few whites and reds, and even fewer that range toward
        yellow. (By the way, there are now over 20,000 hybrids, with about 200 new ones every year.</h3>

    <h2>The Most Misused Common Names of All</h2>
    <h3 id="wildd">If your Aunt Sarah, who knew her plants, told you that wild rose at the farm was a "Pasture Rose", that's fine,
        but don't expect anyone else to know what that means. Pasture Rose, Prairie Rose, Wild Rose, Dog Rose,
        Eglantine, Sweetbriar, and Scotch Briar are just a few of the very common names for wild roses that mean
        different things in different places. (Probably ten different species are called "Pasture Rose" in various parts
        of the country.</h3>
